I want to share my knowledge of software development based on experience and practice, having done tens of thousands of coding lines and thousands of refactorings per year over the years.

I use Twitter a lot, so feel free to talk to me.
I usually tweet in Japanese, but if you speak in English, I will respond accordingly.


I'm not very good at English, so please forgive me if I'm wrong. I would be happy to point out any mistakes.


{{< imgproc "ishibashi_ryuhei.webp" Fit "480x400" "alt='Ishibashi Ryuhei'" ""/>}} I work at a Japanese startup and have extensive experience in agile software development, legacy code improvement, and re-architecture.
And I love Scala and Rust.

Here is the article I would most recommend right now.
