I want to share software development knowledge based on experience and practice after years of doing thousands of refactorings and tens of thousands of lines of coding per year.

I use Twitter a lot, so feel free to talk to me.
I usually tweet in Japanese, but if you speak in English, I will respond in English.


I'm not very good at English, so please forgive me if I'm wrong. I would be happy to point out any mistakes.


{{< imgproc "ishibashi_ryuhei.png" Fit "480x400" "alt='Ishibashi Ryuhei'" ""/>}} I work at a Japanese startup and have extensive experience in agile software development, legacy code improvement, and re-architecture.
And I love Scala and Rust.

Here is the article I would most recommend right now.
